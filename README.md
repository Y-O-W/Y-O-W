TL;DR

Hello Friend,

My name is Yves and I'm a self-employed, experienced Marketer. I help startups and corporate clients to innovate their business through digital transformation and technology. As an independent Project Lead I plan and execute their digital projects successfully. I specialize in Data-Driven Marketing, Analytics and Ecommerce to drive maximum business impact.

I support clients with my expertise on a Marketing as a Service basis and can act as an interim CMO to jump start your Digital Marketing. I guide foreign companies in launching their Go-To-Market strategy in Germany/DACH/Europe. I act as an independent advisor for the successful planning and implementation of your digital marketing strategy.

I have long standing experience in managing clients and projects - digital lately and non-digital before that. I have developed a strong background in project management leading multiple projects for a diverse clientele at the same time. I have been working on ecommerce and web projects for several years now, where I manage designers, developers, partners and clients simultaneously. I'm familiar with project management software like Jira, Basecamp, Trello as well as agile methods like Kanban or Scrum.

I recently finished my 6-month Coding Bootcamp at Le Wagon in Berlin by developing my own first web app. I'm continuing to strengthen my technological skills in order to leverage the use of software, technology and innovation.

I operate on a holistic approach by relying on a growing network of selected and competent partners composed of freelancers, agencies and software providers to cover the most important aspects of the digital customer journey including technology and creative services, with a strong focus on execution.

I currently focus especially on the following areas:
Server Side Tracking with focus on the Google Platform
Headless Commerce solutions with focus on the Shopify Platform
MVP Development for web/cloud based applications

At the moment I'm in charge of developing a new web app for https://www.europeanfilmacademy.org/ and orchestrating the marketing efforts of rising cryptocurrency https://www.nimiq.com/.

If you're interested in working together, please get in touch to discuss your projects further. You can schedule a consultation at https://calendly.com/yowfactor/consultation.

Cheers,

Yves
