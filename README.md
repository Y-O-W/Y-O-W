As a team of Software Architects, UX/UI Designers and Marketers we're helping startups and businesses to jump start their digital brand and scale their distribution with a strong focus on the consumer frontend and a headless backend approach.

I operate on a holistic approach by relying on a growing network of selected and competent partners composed of freelancers, agencies and software providers to cover the most important aspects of the digital customer journey including technology and creative services, with a strong focus on execution.
