TL;DR

Hello Friend,

I'm a self-employed, experienced Marketer & Consultant helping corporate clients to innovate their business through technology and to execute their digital projects successfully as an independent Project Lead. I excel in Data-Driven Marketing, Analytics and Ecommerce to drive maximum business impact.

I offer clients my expertise on a Marketing as a Service basis and can act as an interim CMO to jump start your Digital Marketing. For foreign companies, I offer guidance on launching their digital initiatives in Germany/Europe.

I have long standing experience in managing clients and projects - digital lately and non-digital before that. I have developed a strong background in project management leading multiple projects for a diverse clientele at the same time. I have been working on ecommerce and web projects for several years, where I manage designers, developers, partners and clients simultaneously. I'm familiar with project management software like Jira, Basecamp, Trello as well as agile methods like Kanban or Scrum.

At the moment I'm enrolled in a 6-month Coding Bootcamp at Le Wagon in Berlin. Aiming to strengthen my technological skills to leverage the use of software and innovations as best I can.

I nurture a growing network of selected and competent partners composed of freelancers, agencies and software providers to cover the most important aspects of the digital customer journey including technology and creative services, with a strong focus on execution.

Cheers,

Yves
